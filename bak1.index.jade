              p This year we are revolutionising Food and Drink at Keble Ball. Institutional standard will clash with individual flair in a combination of culinary styles and mixological expression.
              p We have observed the finest cuisines from all around the world, and made a selection for your enjoyment. On 7th May 2016 you will watch as they sate your appetite and ensure your satisfaction.
              p Drinks will bubble, steam and glow, spilling over as the night passes on. The crowds will ebb and flow, and as the tide turns your energy levels will rise, injected with our concoctions.
              p You will enjoy the food. You will enjoy the drink. You will have fun.

              p Welcome to Keble Ball; your adventure has begun. Entertainment awaits you, and you will have fun.
              p On Pusey Quad, you will not break free from the unstoppable beats created by hit house djs. Your energy will rise as some of the freshest talent in grime and garage take to the stage, and you will put on your dancing shoes to some classic rock and roll.
              p You will flee to Hayward Quad, where you will find uproarious drag acts and comedy performances. You will remember however, that even the darkest of comedy will not hide you. Beneath Keble's watchful spires, you will enter our experience rooms, where your senses will be attacked by unfamiliar noises, tastes, smells and sensations. After momentary respite, you will return to Pusey Quad for our headline performer, and you will dance and sing like never before.
              p You will do all this and more. When the morning is upon you, you will not wish to run. Keble Ball will ensnare you, and you will have fun.

              p Keble Ball is recruiting. We need you to get involved in the operations of the night and make sure everyone has fun.
              
              p There are 2 types of position to apply for:
              .ul
                li <strong>Managers</strong>: you will be in charge of small teams, managing either bars or the cellar. These few spots will be given to those with experience. You will be expected to work for the full night.
                li <strong>General Staff</strong>: you will help serve food and drink and assist with the logistics of the Ball. You can work half the night â€“ either in the first half or the second half of the Ball - and earn a reduced price ticket. Alternatively you can work the full night and receive payment in return.
                
              p This year we have an exciting collaboration with Queen's Ball, for which we have two offers:
              .ul
                li Any worker who chooses to work at both Balls will get the oppurtunity to earn more off their discounted ticket price for each Ball.
                li Half shift workers will be able to work the 1st shift for one Ball and the 2nd shift for the other, meaning that they will definitely be able to enjoy the second half of one Ball.
                
              p Please note that you will be required to attend a training session prior to the Ball in 1st or 2nd week of Trinity term.

              p If you are interested in working at the Ball, please fill in the Google form at <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/ElwKZDuKZ1">http://goo.gl/forms/ElwKZDuKZ1</a> by 11pm on Saturday 27th February 2016 to convince us why you are the best person for the job. Following this you may be invited to a short interview, and you will hear shortly afterwards if your application has been successful.
